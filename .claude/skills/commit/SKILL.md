# Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

## Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

## Types

- `feat`: User-facing features or behavior changes (must change production code)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (must change production code)
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: CI/CD, tooling, dependency bumps, configs (no production code)

## Scopes

Optional. Use when it adds clarity. Examples: `collector`, `server`, `store`, `recorder`, `state`, `flipfix`, `cli`.

## Examples

```text
feat(server): add sparkline charts to dashboard
fix(recorder): handle connection timeout during polling
refactor(state): simplify rolling average calculation
chore: add ruff linting configuration
docs: update CLAUDE.md with new architecture
test(store): add tests for assignment queries
```

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged` to see staged changes
2. Analyze the changes and determine the appropriate type
3. Write a concise description (under 72 characters)
4. Add body only if the "why" isn't obvious from the description
